Special thanks to Lama Dev for their inspiring YouTube video that served as a foundation for this project. While the project started with their guidance, I've taken the initiative to improve certain features and introduce transitions and animations to elevate the overall experience.

## What Next 🔮
I have exciting plans for the future of this project. I aim to expand it into a full-stack application by integrating Node.js and Express for backend functionality. This will allow for more advanced features, user authentication, and a complete end-to-end experience.
